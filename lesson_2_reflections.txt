What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    when a respository is initialized, a .git folder is created within the current folder.
    it does not track any files it isnt't told to track.
    
    This needs to be done so that git can later be given commands to track the changes to this repository.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?


    the staging area is the files (which are in the working directory) that git will actually track.
    When initialising a project, it is helpful to add files bit by (relevent bit) therefore,
    by adding and removing files from the staging area, files can be commited in a logical order.
