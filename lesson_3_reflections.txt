When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    a remote repository means that any code that has been added is "cloud" based, meaning
    it is a simply way to back it up. Also, remote repositories can be worked on by many people
    allowing easy collabouration.
    
    an extra bonus is allowing one to work on a project from multiple computers.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    push and pull should be manual for several reasons:
    
    github tends to be public (unless paid for) so experimental features should remain on
    a local directory. 
    
    if the remote repository is operatored by somebody else, they may not be happy with your changes
    happening without their approval.
    
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    A fork is used when one does not have permission to push to the origin master. (this may be granted later)
    
    A clone is used to copy an entire project (including its history) to ones own repository (local or remote)
    
    a branch is used to add a new feature.
    
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    Reduces the odds of merge conflicts, if the head is at 2 different places then merges can 
    be completed offline.
    
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

    While it has been done in the past, in my opinion, this sort of collab would be very difficult. 
    it would require hard and difficult planning, ensuring that people worked in such a way as to 
    not interfier with each others progress.
    
    what would be easier?
        not having to learn git.
        
    what would be harder?
        everything else.
