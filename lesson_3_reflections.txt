When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    a remote repository means that any code that has been added is "cloud" based, meaning
    it is a simply way to back it up. Also, remote repositories can be worked on by many people
    allowing easy collabouration.
    
    an extra bonus is allowing one to work on a project from multiple computers.
