When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    a remote repository means that any code that has been added is "cloud" based, meaning
    it is a simply way to back it up. Also, remote repositories can be worked on by many people
    allowing easy collabouration.
    
    an extra bonus is allowing one to work on a project from multiple computers.
    
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    push and pull should be manual for several reasons:
    
    github tends to be public (unless paid for) so experimental features should remain on
    a local directory. 
    
    if the remote repository is operatored by somebody else, they may not be happy with your changes
    happening without their approval.
